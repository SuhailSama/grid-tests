# Test a very basic shell script with different variants of the shell option,
# including the default setting.
#
# Note that for all shells in the grid's login_shells list, it will source the
# full user profile at the start of the job.  If you use a shell not in that
# list (like zsh) it will start as a non-login shell.  As of this writing
# login_shells is set to sh,bash,ksh,csh,tcsh.  To see the current list run
# "qconf -sconf" and see the login_shells entry there.
